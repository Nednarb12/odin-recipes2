    <h3>In this <em>sweet</em> American sandwhich we have elements of flavor that defy it's simplistic construsction.
    It has been a favorite in many lunchrooms in the K-12 world as well as a quick snack in the adult working world, due to it's preservation and small list of ingredients.
Lets learn how to perfect it!</h3>
        <h4>List of ingredients:</h4>
            <ul> 
                <li>Peaunt Butter. <em>This normally can be found in the <strong>crunchy</strong>or <strong>creamy</strong> variety</em></li>
                <li>Jelly. <em>Normally found in the <strong>grape</strong> variety, there are many other fruity flavors. <strong>Jam</strong> is a popular substitute.</em></li>
                <li>Two Bread Slices.<em> This is traditionally made with <strong>white</strong> bread, however this is also flexible, perhaps avoid the savory breads though!</em> </li>
            </ul>
    <h3>Now that we have our ingredients on the counter, let's look at some options we have on how to create your entree!</h3>
        <h4>Preperation:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>The first step is the most crucial, we need to decide if we want a cold or warm entree. If cold we can skip to step 3, if warm please proceed to step 2.</li>
                <li><strong>Warm Entree:</strong> Place both slices of bread into toaster, use desired setting.</li>
                <li>Using a butterknife, spread <strong>peanut butter</strong> evenly onto one side of bread slice.</li>
                <li>Clean butterknife with clean wet towel, and then spread <strong>jelly</strong> evenly on one side of another slice of bread.</li>
                <li>If you had toasted your bread, you may like to keep the bread slices separately prepared, if that is the case then <em>Bon Apetit!</em> Otherwise, place both slices togther so that the <em>dry</em> side of the bread is
                facing outward.</li>
                <li>You have now created a culinary masterpiece. Enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
